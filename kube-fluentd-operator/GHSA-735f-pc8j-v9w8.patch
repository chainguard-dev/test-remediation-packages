# No changes required - google-protobuf vulnerability GHSA-735f-pc8j-v9w8 is already remediated
# 
# The Melange YAML pipeline already contains the necessary sed command to update
# google-protobuf from version 3.22.1 to 3.25.5 in fluent-plugin-google-cloud.gemspec:
#
# sed -e "s/'google-protobuf', '3.22.1'/'google-protobuf', '3.25.5'/g" -i fluent-plugin-google-cloud.gemspec
#
# This addresses the vulnerability by updating to the target version 3.25.5.
# The image/Gemfile does not contain google-protobuf as a direct dependency.
# No additional patches are required.
